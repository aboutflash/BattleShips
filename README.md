BattleShips
===========

A mini game to try out object oriented programming with starling.
Just for fun.

> **NOTE** This game was created during an 5 day introduction session into object oriented programming. There's a lot to refactor, though this game finally worked for us and entirely fulfilled it's purpose - as an example.

How does it work?
-----------------

Two players steer a simple ship like sprite and shoot at each other until ones ship has no remaining health points. Ok, I'm sure there a are more promising game concepts out there. ;)

Roadmap
-------

- Refactor the code. (Remove shame)
- Create scenes to represent the different menu and battle states. (Useful to explain *compartmentation*)
- Separate logic and views better. (Useful to explain *MVC* paradigm)
- Create different types of battle ships. (Useful to explain *interfaces* and *factory pattern*)
